        <!-- 
            Hello anyone looking in my site's source code!
            I'm Kiwian. Thank you for being here, in my website's source.
            All of this site was made by hand. I've never taken a course
            on HTML or anything, just slowly built up knowledge over the years.
            That being said, I still don't work with web languages very often
            so my site isn't the best. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy it.
            I'm very lazy with updating this, sorry ;)
        -->
