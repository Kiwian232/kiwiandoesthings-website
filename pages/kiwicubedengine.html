                <p>Kiwi³ Engine is a game I'm working on. Let me explain. <br>Kiwi³ is <strong>going</strong> to be a highly modifiable game. Pretty much all vanilla content will come in the form of pre-installed content packs. As well as those vanilla packs, you'll be able to install custom packs to mod the game. With this system, the game can act more like a game engine or just a highly moddable game. Kiwi³ is intended to be more of a "Minecraft engine" than a voxel engine, because it doesn't use traditional voxels or voxel rendering, but rather uses elements more similar to Minecraft.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Kiwi³ started from a place of distate for Minecraft I have. Minecaft has a lot of issues, too many too list. Kiwi³ in both the engine and vanilla content pack side is designed to not have a lot of these issues people have with Minecraft.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>So what's the status of the project then?</h2>
                <p>Well you should take a look at the GitHub for that.</p>
