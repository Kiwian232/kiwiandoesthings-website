            Hello anyone looking in my site's source code!
            I'm Kiwian. Thank you for being here, in my website's source.
            All of this site was made by hand. I've never taken a course
            on HTML or anything, just slowly built up knowledge over the years.
            That being said, I still don't work with web languages very often
            so my site isn't the best. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy it.
            I'm very lazy with updating this, sorry ;)

                <p>Kiwi³ Engine is a game I'm working on. Let me explain. <br>Kiwi³ is <strong>going</strong> to be a highly modifiable game. Pretty much all vanilla content will come in the form of pre-installed content packs. As well as those vanilla packs, you'll be able to install custom packs to mod the game. With this system, the game can act more like a game engine or just a highly moddable game. Kiwi³ is intended to be more of a "Minecraft engine" than a voxel engine, because it doesn't use traditional voxels or voxel rendering, but rather uses elements more similar to Minecraft.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Kiwi³ started from a place of distate for Minecraft I have. Minecaft has a lot of issues, too many too list. Kiwi³ in both the engine and vanilla content pack side is designed to not have a lot of these issues people have with Minecraft.</p>

                <p>Well here's what I'm working on currently:</p>
