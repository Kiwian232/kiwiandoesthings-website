        		This page is as much for you as it is me. Just helps to keep track of everything. It also works as a graveyard for any dead projects. <br>
            	Active projects are being worked on as of now. <br>
            	Stalled projects are taking a short break (usually 7-48 days). <br>
            	Halted projects are either finished or cancelled (they may be revived and go back into development). <br>
