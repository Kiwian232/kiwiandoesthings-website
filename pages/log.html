                 heallo!! I've done a little bit of stuff since last post. Mostly, my MC server, PSMP, just went into its season 2. So that's been taking up a little bit of my time. Other than that, school is back in session after winter break, and it's a new year. I'm still working on KiwiCubed, albeit slowly because I'm finding lots of underlying systems need to be refactored while working on the modding API that needs to be implemented before release. <br>
				 <br>
				 I'm also still working on this website some. At the very least, I want to keep doing regular blog posts, but I've also been cleaning up the source code (mostly the fuckass inconsistent indentation from neocities) and I'll be trying to expand it some. Between KiwiCubed, my server, making art, and maintaining this site, I'm quite busy. So really don't expect any of those things I've listed to be happening a lot or very quickly. Cuz I've also got school to deal with, which is gonna take up most of my time for a while. We'll see what I can do though. <br>
				 <br>
				 Oh also I'm still trying to work on that game I mentioned earlier, basically no progress has been made since I mentioned it (of course right) but that's mostly because I lost all of my work (which wasn't really that much tbh, also don't ask) a while ago and just haven't restarted work on it yet.

                 Happy thanksgiving !! i. have been doing some stuff.
                 <br>
                 KiwiCubed holds a near and dear place in my heart, but im working on a different game for now. The entire point of KiwiCubed is that, like Minecraft, it's never supposed to be "finished". That being said, I <i>REALLY</i> want to actually have a FINISHED game for once. I've been doing programming and gamedev for years at this point, and I have never finished a game of any sort of real size. And even if KiwiCubed was going to be finished eventually, it wouldn't be anytime soon. So for now I'm working on a little game with a lot of help from PSMP (<a href="smp.kiwiandoesthings.place" target="_blank">my Minecraft SMP</a>) members.
                 <br>
                 Also school is a bitch. I really don't have much time to work on stuff anyways. I only started that new project because I just started getting a little bit more time, but I'm still busy a lot right now, so I don't have much time to work on anything.
                 <br>
                 I also wanna overhaul this website's design still. I might do that whenever I have time and remember to do it.

                <p>
                  So... The question you've all been asking for the past month... Did I do any of the stuff I said I wanted to in the last update..? <br>
                  <br>
                  Well uh... kinda.<br>
                  <br>
                  At the very least I can say I got in a good few KiwiCubed commits, and I created a whole "new" (mostly copied from here) website. What for, you ask? Well, I've "inherited" a Minecraft SMP in a roundabout way. I've been spending a lot of time setting that up, and its related projects. <br>
                  <br>
                  This is a callback to the period of time before when I was playing on the server (had not yet inherited) and had a similar issue where the server took up any available creative time I had. It's okay though, because this time, uhh.... this time.... uhmmmmmmm,,, <sub>sidenote can you believe how shitty commas look in this font (i really gotta update it)</sub><br>
                  <br>
                  Anyways I've still been working on stuff, and I will continue to be. In the meantime, in the very very highly very small miniscule chance someone is not only reading this (i doubt it already) but also <i>wants</i> to join the smp, look no further than right <a href="https://smp.kiwiandoesthings.place">here</a>. See? I told you I just stole this website's code for it. <br>
                  <h4>Part 2: I thought I was done with this post then I encountered an encounter and now I must cancel my being done with this: </h4>
                  why tf is this page called log... i swear i woulda called it blog... log doesnt even really make much sense. i thought about changing this to b(Log) or just blog but neither of them looked right so its staying this way. hooray.

                <p class="blog-date">8/28/2025</p>
                <p>
                  Gonna try to do some stuff. I've got way more work with school and such than I have ever before, but I'm hoping to make some website updates sometime. Maybe I'll even get in a KiwiCubed commit. Also I've been wanting to write for a long long time, and have been sitting on a small story for months now. I get the craziest creative block though, because I'm a terribly uncreative person. And all my good ideas come while I'm trying to fall asleep, or in a situation where I can't write them down. Maybe (hopefully) I'll think something up and get some words down though. The creative urge has been building up ever since the last website update and I finally have a little bit of time to let it out. Also god forbid you see the raw html for these blog posts. I rarely use linebreak tags, so this whole post (and another longer one) is on one single line. Anyways, I know likely no one sees these (and if you do you better put something in the Chattable on the home page >:3) but have fun, byea!! <br>
                  <br>
                  P.S. thinking about adding a password sort of thing to the website to keep myself from getting accidentally outed as trans to my irl friends. if you are somehow a person that sees these and don't want your access locked out please just dm me on discord or something. (this might not happen its just something i have cooking)

                <p>
                  This site is no longer hosted on Neocities. Despite how much I love Neocities, I kinda wanted my own domain and didn't want to pay a domain <i>and</i> their premium plan. So instead I now have a Cloudflare domain and have the website hosted on GitHub. <br>
                  This site needs some cleaning up and redesigning anyways, and I bought this domain because I wanted to pay some more attention to it. Right now this site is mostly for fun, but I plan to get some good use out of it once I have some more stuff to show off on it. <br>
                  That's all. Seeya!

                  After a good week of not being able to bring myself to do anything, I've finished a new page, <a href="statuses.html">statuses</a>. I really do want to actually add some polish now and add some buttons like I said I was going to do.

                <p>
                  With the addition of the art dump page, the last page to be finshed is this, the log. The website isn't finished of course, but it is in a usable state. I plan on putting more of the little things I'm working on here, some buttons/rings/whatever, and maybe a <a href="https://iframe.chat/demo/" target="_blank">chat</a>. I also want a better about me section. I know I have better stuff to say then repeating "i like coding + im trans" over and over again, I just genuinely forget it. This log will act as not only a little space where I will share my thoughts, but also as a changelog for the website now that it's complete. I've also decided to maybe expand on my font and add some extra glyphs for typing in Spanish, and some currency/mathematics glyphs. Anyways, that's all I have to say for now. I took a lot of inspiration in making all aspects of my website, so if you want to see the tabs I've had open for the past week look at these sites:
