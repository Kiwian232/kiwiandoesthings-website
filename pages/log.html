            Hello anyone looking in my site's source code!
            I'm Kiwian. Thank you for being here, in my website's source.
            All of this site was made by hand. I've never taken a course
            on HTML or anything, just slowly built up knowledge over the years.
            That being said, I still don't work with web languages very often
            so my site isn't the best. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy it.
            I'm very lazy with updating this, sorry ;)
        -->

                <p>
                  Gonna try to do some stuff. I've got way more work with school and such than I have ever before, but I'm hoping to make some website updates sometime. Maybe I'll even get in a KiwiCubed commit. Also I've been wanting to write for a long long time, and have been sitting on a small story for months now. I get the craziest creative block though, because I'm a terribly uncreative person. And all my good ideas come while I'm trying to fall asleep, or in a situation where I can't write them down. Maybe (hopefully) I'll think something up and get some words down though. The creative urge has been building up ever since the last website update and I finally have a little bit of time to let it out. Also god forbid you see the raw html for these blog posts. I rarely use linebreak tags, so this whole post (and another longer one) is on one single line. Anyways, I know likely no one sees these (and if you do you better put something in the Chattable on the home page >:3) but have fun, byea!! <br>
                  <br>
                  P.S. thinking about adding a password sort of thing to the website to keep myself from getting accidentally outed as trans to my irl friends. if you are somehow a person that sees these and don't want your access locked out please just dm me on discord or something. (this might not happen its just something i have cooking)

                  This site is no longer hosted on Neocities. Despite how much I love Neocities, I kinda wanted my own domain and didn't want to pay a domain <i>and</i> their premium plan. So instead I now have a Cloudflare domain and have the website hosted on GitHub. <br>
                  This site needs some cleaning up and redesigning anyways, and I bought this domain because I wanted to pay some more attention to it. Right now this site is mostly for fun, but I plan to get some good use out of it once I have some more stuff to show off on it. <br>
                  That's all. Seeya!

                  After a good week of not being able to bring myself to do anything, I've finished a new page, <a href="statuses.html">statuses</a>. I really do want to actually add some polish now and add some buttons like I said I was going to do.

                  With the addition of the art dump page, the last page to be finshed is this, the log. The website isn't finished of course, but it is in a usable state. I plan on putting more of the little things I'm working on here, some buttons/rings/whatever, and maybe a <a href="https://iframe.chat/demo/" target="_blank">chat</a>. I also want a better about me section. I know I have better stuff to say then repeating "i like coding + im trans" over and over again, I just genuinely forget it. This log will act as not only a little space where I will share my thoughts, but also as a changelog for the website now that it's complete. I've also decided to maybe expand on my font and add some extra glyphs for typing in Spanish, and some currency/mathematics glyphs. Anyways, that's all I have to say for now. I took a lot of inspiration in making all aspects of my website, so if you want to see the tabs I've had open for the past week look at these sites:
