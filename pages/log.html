                <p class="blog-date">2/27/2026</p>
                <p>
                Yes it seems my monthly blog-making urge has returned. So what's going on? I'm rewriting KiwiCubed in C# from C++. This is kind of a big deal. I'm once again (re)starting a project in a language that I don't really know. It's gonna take a good while just to get back to where I was before. But it won't be impossible. What's more interesting, I think, is why I decided to this and my thought process.<br>
				<br>
				I've always told myself that I really like C++, that I love it even. But the truth is, it kinda sucks. I've always known how finnicky of a language it is, and how hard it is to work with, and especially learn. For every concept you learn in C++, you have to also learn 100 different exceptions and sub-concepts, and that makes it really difficult to use. As well, many things have several ways to go about them. Things like member variable initialization for classes, instantiating objects, and passing functions all have so many ways to go about them. That makes it hard to ever know if you're doing it right, or to be consistent. There are plenty of other grievances I have with it too, and some stuff I just hadn't really realized I'd been fighting with yet that I learned about in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fGB-hjc2Gc" target="_blank">this video</a> (don't mind the bajillions of ai generated images).<br>
				<br>
				But basically, I'd felt all of these stupid things I'd been dealing with in C++, and kinda just told myself that that's what I loved about the fuckass language. But I'm gonna be real, I was 100% tricking myself and I was just biased. C++ was the first "real" language I'd learned (sorry JS), and, given the time it takes to learn a new language, it was the only one I wanted to learn for a long while. And because of that, I guess I decided I really had to love it, but I don't. I like a lot of things about it, still. I adore its syntax, and I really enjoy things like operator overloads for structs and such. But it really does suck in a lot of ways.<br>
				<br>
				One extremely large and quite very relevant way that C++ sucks is in its reflection. Now I don't think that not having reflection is like an objectively bad thing. But it's really fucking useful for making modding way easier. Instead of a super complex, slow (runtime and dev time), and limited scripting API, having good reflection lets people just write mods that are actually loaded into the game. And this is something C++ doesn't have at all.<br>
				Now, what is a language that's very much like C, has the cool features from C++, but also has great reflection (and even a gc!!!). Yes, it's C#. I won't lie, for a long time, I really didn't like C# just because I figured it must suck, being a Micrsoft product. But I like it a lot now that I've started using it. (The almond braces and naming conventions are gonna make me fucking off myself though (I'm ignoring them and using my old C++ style anyways because fuck you)).<br>
				<br>
				Anyways so yeah that's fun. Oh also I read Homestuck. And the epilgoues. Not HS^2 though becusue it kinda fucking sucked (more than the epilgoues even!!!). I started reading some fanworks instead on mspfa and holy wow they're so much better than the epilgoues n stuff they're absolutely amazing I love them anyways bye.

                <h3 class="blog-title">okayy hi</h3>
                <p class="blog-date">2/20/2026</p>
                <p>
                I just finished making a game. In fact, this is arguably the first game I've finished. Now if you know a lot about my history programming (no one does so I'll explain it) you might be a little surprised by this.<br>
				<br>
				I've been programming for about 4 years now. I started back in 5th grade by using my school laptop to do Khan Academy courses. I learned very basic JavaScript from those courses. After I finished all of the available programming courses, I moved on to Code.org. At this time, I still knew basically nothing about programming, so I was very confused when my <span class="code">ellipse()</span> and <span class="code">rect()</span> methods didn't work outside of Khan Academy. Code.org then became my first real introduction to programming. I was still under the umbrealla of a high-level API <i>on top</i> of programming in JS, but I was aware of it now.<br>
				<br>
				Once I had fucked around in Code.org for long enough, with my realization that the programs I'd been using to code were basically doing everything for me, I decided to learn HTML and actual JS to make some raw websites. In 6th grade, I spent a lot of my time making really simple games using <span class="code">&lt;canvas&gt;</span> elements and the canvas drawing API in JS.<br>
				<br>
				By the time I was in 7th grade, I decided to learn C++. Admittedly, this was quite the jump, but I was well-versed in basic programming and its concepts. And so, I started work on a project that I would be working on whilst learning the language it was built in, C++. This project is currently known as KiwiCubed, and I'm still working on it, 2 years later.<br>
				<br>
				Anyways, that's all besides the point. What I've been trying to show is that, I've been making games for years at this point. In fact, I've made a ton of games. But I've never finished any of them. The games that really would count as an actual "game", I simply never finished. And the projects I did finish weren't as much "games" as just programming practice. (And KiwiCubed is neither finished nor a game).<br>
				<br>
				But about 2 months ago, I started making a game in GameMaker (lol) for the members of the PSMP Discord/Minecraft server. This game, aptly named, was the PSMP Game. After 2 months and a little bit of scope downsizing, I finished it, my first real game. It included saving/loading (something I'd never worked with before), an actual startup menu, real gameplay, some semblance of a plot, cutscenes, and an "ending".<br>
				<br>
				Obviously, not all of those items are required for something to be a game; however, I feel they very much legitemized it enough for me to consider it my first game.<br>
				<br>
				Now, is the game any good? No. While the art is some of the best stuff I've done yet, it's still really bad. The story was hastily put together. The rooms and room layout was planned exactly once and basically never iterated on. The level design is pretty uninteresting. The gameplay only comes in the form of fights and puzzles and neither are done particularly well or interestingly. And everything is really finnick and hastily put together. The code in that game is by far some of the worst stuff I've ever written, and I had to spend an evening rewriting a system that already took me 6 hours to write originally because it sucked so badly.<br>
				<br>
				However, it is my first full game, and I did have fun making it for the most part. There were a few mistakes I made that made it a little less fun at the end, but I still am glad I made it. After all, that's what I like to do, make games.<br>
				<br>
				This was a long asf post, definitely the longest here. Sorry. If you read this or any of these in general you should put something in the <a href="https://kiwiandoesthings.place/pages/home.html">Chattable</a> on the homepage for fun.<br>
				<br>
				If you'd like to play the game (or view the project files), you can do so <a href="https://kiwiandoesthings.itch.io/psmp-game">here</a>.

                <h3 class="blog-title">wow its sure is a new year</h3>
                <p class="blog-date">1/6/2026</p>
                <p>
                 heallo!! I've done a little bit of stuff since last post. Mostly, my MC server, PSMP, just went into its season 2. So that's been taking up a little bit of my time. Other than that, school is back in session after winter break, and it's a new year. I'm still working on KiwiCubed, albeit slowly because I'm finding lots of underlying systems need to be refactored while working on the modding API that needs to be implemented before release. <br>
				 <br>
				 I'm also still working on this website some. At the very least, I want to keep doing regular blog posts, but I've also been cleaning up the source code (mostly the fuckass inconsistent indentation from neocities) and I'll be trying to expand it some. Between KiwiCubed, my server, making art, and maintaining this site, I'm quite busy. So really don't expect any of those things I've listed to be happening a lot or very quickly. Cuz I've also got school to deal with, which is gonna take up most of my time for a while. We'll see what I can do though. <br>
				 <br>
				 Oh also I'm still trying to work on that game I mentioned earlier, basically no progress has been made since I mentioned it (of course right) but that's mostly because I lost all of my work (which wasn't really that much tbh, also don't ask) a while ago and just haven't restarted work on it yet.

                <p>
                 Happy thanksgiving !! i. have been doing some stuff.
                 <br>
                 KiwiCubed holds a near and dear place in my heart, but im working on a different game for now. The entire point of KiwiCubed is that, like Minecraft, it's never supposed to be "finished". That being said, I <i>REALLY</i> want to actually have a FINISHED game for once. I've been doing programming and gamedev for years at this point, and I have never finished a game of any sort of real size. And even if KiwiCubed was going to be finished eventually, it wouldn't be anytime soon. So for now I'm working on a little game with a lot of help from PSMP (<a href="smp.kiwiandoesthings.place" target="_blank">my Minecraft SMP</a>) members.
                 <br>
                 Also school is a bitch. I really don't have much time to work on stuff anyways. I only started that new project because I just started getting a little bit more time, but I'm still busy a lot right now, so I don't have much time to work on anything.
                 <br>
                 I also wanna overhaul this website's design still. I might do that whenever I have time and remember to do it.

                <p class="blog-date">10/2/2025</p>
                <p>
                  So... The question you've all been asking for the past month... Did I do any of the stuff I said I wanted to in the last update..? <br>
                  <br>
                  Well uh... kinda.<br>
                  <br>
                  At the very least I can say I got in a good few KiwiCubed commits, and I created a whole "new" (mostly copied from here) website. What for, you ask? Well, I've "inherited" a Minecraft SMP in a roundabout way. I've been spending a lot of time setting that up, and its related projects. <br>
                  <br>
                  This is a callback to the period of time before when I was playing on the server (had not yet inherited) and had a similar issue where the server took up any available creative time I had. It's okay though, because this time, uhh.... this time.... uhmmmmmmm,,, <sub>sidenote can you believe how shitty commas look in this font (i really gotta update it)</sub><br>
                  <br>
                  Anyways I've still been working on stuff, and I will continue to be. In the meantime, in the very very highly very small miniscule chance someone is not only reading this (i doubt it already) but also <i>wants</i> to join the smp, look no further than right <a href="https://smp.kiwiandoesthings.place">here</a>. See? I told you I just stole this website's code for it. <br>
                  <h4>Part 2: I thought I was done with this post then I encountered an encounter and now I must cancel my being done with this: </h4>
                  why tf is this page called log... i swear i woulda called it blog... log doesnt even really make much sense. i thought about changing this to b(Log) or just blog but neither of them looked right so its staying this way. hooray.

                <p class="blog-date">8/28/2025</p>
                <p>
                  Gonna try to do some stuff. I've got way more work with school and such than I have ever before, but I'm hoping to make some website updates sometime. Maybe I'll even get in a KiwiCubed commit. Also I've been wanting to write for a long long time, and have been sitting on a small story for months now. I get the craziest creative block though, because I'm a terribly uncreative person. And all my good ideas come while I'm trying to fall asleep, or in a situation where I can't write them down. Maybe (hopefully) I'll think something up and get some words down though. The creative urge has been building up ever since the last website update and I finally have a little bit of time to let it out. Also god forbid you see the raw html for these blog posts. I rarely use linebreak tags, so this whole post (and another longer one) is on one single line. Anyways, I know likely no one sees these (and if you do you better put something in the Chattable on the home page >:3) but have fun, byea!! <br>
                  <br>
                  P.S. thinking about adding a password sort of thing to the website to keep myself from getting accidentally outed as trans to my irl friends. if you are somehow a person that sees these and don't want your access locked out please just dm me on discord or something. (this might not happen its just something i have cooking)

                <p>
                  This site is no longer hosted on Neocities. Despite how much I love Neocities, I kinda wanted my own domain and didn't want to pay a domain <i>and</i> their premium plan. So instead I now have a Cloudflare domain and have the website hosted on GitHub. <br>
                  This site needs some cleaning up and redesigning anyways, and I bought this domain because I wanted to pay some more attention to it. Right now this site is mostly for fun, but I plan to get some good use out of it once I have some more stuff to show off on it. <br>
                  That's all. Seeya!

                <p>
                  After a good week of not being able to bring myself to do anything, I've finished a new page, <a href="statuses.html">statuses</a>. I really do want to actually add some polish now and add some buttons like I said I was going to do.

                <p>
                  With the addition of the art dump page, the last page to be finshed is this, the log. The website isn't finished of course, but it is in a usable state. I plan on putting more of the little things I'm working on here, some buttons/rings/whatever, and maybe a <a href="https://iframe.chat/demo/" target="_blank">chat</a>. I also want a better about me section. I know I have better stuff to say then repeating "i like coding + im trans" over and over again, I just genuinely forget it. This log will act as not only a little space where I will share my thoughts, but also as a changelog for the website now that it's complete. I've also decided to maybe expand on my font and add some extra glyphs for typing in Spanish, and some currency/mathematics glyphs. Anyways, that's all I have to say for now. I took a lot of inspiration in making all aspects of my website, so if you want to see the tabs I've had open for the past week look at these sites:
