      Hello anyone looking in my site's source code!
      I'm Kiwian. Thank you for being here, in my website's source.
      All of this site was made by hand. I've never taken a course
      on HTML or anything, just slowly built up knowledge over the years.
      That being said, I still don't work with web languages very often
      so my site isn't the best. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy it.
      I'm very lazy with updating this, sorry ;)

          Hello and welcome to The Kiwi Zone! You are safe here. This is where I will have my art and projects linked, as well as where I'll maybe make blog posts sometimes. <br>
          Currently mostly working on a voxel-style engine called KiwiCubed. It might be open to check out some time later this year. <br>
          If it wasn't a bit obvious, I like programming. I make games in C++/OpenGL, I make websites sometimes, and I've made a few web games too. <br>
          I also make some pixel art of my oc, Pixian. And sometimes I even animate it a little. Art isn't quite my strong suit. <br>
          <br>
          Oh, and I almost forgot to mention I'm <span style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);"><span style="color: #5BCEFA;">t</span><span style="color: #F5A9B8;">r</span><span style="color: #FFFFFF;">a</span><span style="color: #F5A9B8;">n</span><span style="color: #5BCEFA;">s</span></span> and go by Kiwian. (White on yellow is great for the eyes).
          <br>
          Almost all of the colors in the website are from a single color palette, that being Pixian's. I try my best to make all art of her and associated works with <a href="../resources/kiwian_palette.png" target="_blank">that palette</a>. <br>
