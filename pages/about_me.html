        <!-- 
            Hello anyone looking in my site's source code!
            I'm Kiwian. Thank you for being here, in my website's source.
            All of this site was made by hand. I've never taken a course
            on HTML or anything, just slowly built up knowledge over the years.
            That being said, I still don't work with web languages very often
            so my site isn't the best. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy it.
            I'm very lazy with updating this, sorry ;)
        -->

                <br>
                I like to do stuff. I mostly like to do stuff I'm good at, but I really like to dabble in a bit of everything. I mainly make games, but I also make pixel art, make animations in Blender, and have at least tried to make some music. I would really like to actually improve in the areas I'm not as good at, but I feel I don't have enough time to work on my ongoing projects <em>and</em> learn new things. <br>
                <br>
                I actually only picked up programming a few years ago when I started learning javascript. I made so many &lt;canvas&gt; web games back then. I tried for  while to get into making games with Unity or GameMaker but it was never for me. Eventually, I learned C++ and kinda fell in <span style="color: #ff6b9f;">love</span> with it. <br>
