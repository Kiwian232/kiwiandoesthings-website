        <!-- 
            Hello anyone looking in my site's source code!
            I'm Kiwian. Thank you for being here, in my website's source.
            All of this site was made by hand. I've never taken a course
            on HTML or anything, just slowly built up knowledge over the years.
            That being said, I still don't work with web languages very often
            so my site isn't the best. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy it.
            I'm very lazy with updating this, sorry ;)
        -->

                  With the addition of the art dump page, the last page to be finshed is this, the log. The website isn't finished of course, but it is in a usable state. I plan on putting more of the little things I'm working on here, some buttons/rings/whatever, and maybe a <a href="https://iframe.chat/demo/" target="_blank">chat</a>. I also want a better about me section. I know I have better stuff to say then repeating "i like coding + im trans" over and over again, I just genuinely forget it. This log will act as not only a little space where I will share my thoughts, but also as a changelog for the website now that it's complete. I've also decided to maybe expand on my font and add some extra glyphs for typing in Spanish, and some currency/mathematics glyphs. Anyways, that's all I have to say for now. I took a lot of inspiration in making all aspects of my website, so if you want to see the tabs I've had open for the past week look at these sites:

                  After a good week of not being able to bring myself to do anything, I've finished a new page, <a href="statuses.html">statuses</a>. I really do want to actually add some polish now and add some buttons like I said I was going to do.
